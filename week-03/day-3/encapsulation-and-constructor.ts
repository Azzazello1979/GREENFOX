// Encapsulation is one of the main concepts in object oriented programming.
// It allows an object to group both private and public members under a single name.
//
// members mean fields and also functions(methods)
//
// A class can control the visibility of its data members to members of other classes.
// This capability is termed as Data Hiding or ENCAPSULATION.
//
// Object Orientation uses the concept of access modifiers or access specifiers 
// to implement the concept of Encapsulation.
// The access specifiers/modifiers define the visibility of a classâ€™s data members outside its defining class.
//
// Access specifiers/modifiers:
//
// public - members are public by default, universal accessibility
// private - Private data members are accessible only within the class that defines these members.
// protected - members can only be accessed within the same class and also by children of the class
